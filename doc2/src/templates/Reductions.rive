+ war eight four three
-  <set eight={@eight cultures}> <set four={@four cultures}> <set three={@three cultures}> <set nine={@nine cultures}> <set six={@six cultures}> The war began as an uneasy alliance between the <get four> and The <get eight>. The <get eight> had attacked the <get four> before. But this time they had a common enemy in the <get three> . In the first battles, the <get four>' higher intelligence and the <get eight>' numerical superiority proved decisive. Unable to call upon their traditional allies <get six>, <get three> even appealed to <get nine> for mediation. But large numbers of casualties on both sides proved politically costly to the leaders of <get three>, and so their successors sued for peace.

+ war one three
-  <set one={@one cultures}> <set three={@three cultures}>  A trade dispute arose between <get one> and <get three>. <get one> tried to focus the negotiations on the single trade issue, but <get three> wanted to open them up to a broard range of across-the-board issues between them. <get one> still holds its old grievance against <get three>, but <get three> believes it has put the past behind it with all the recent reforms.
