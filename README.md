# RiverScriptBot
##A riverscript based Javascript chatbot

Backstory. Back in college, I was inspired by not only how humans interact with PC's but how PC's interact with humans. At the time... there were not a lot of options. That said, at one time, I had an AOL instant messenger source code project, which I tied to Sarra, with an MS agent, and had it IM'ing a chatbot. Fastforward a few years, and the AIM client can't connect. I ran into [AIML](http://www.aiml.foundation/) and the Alice project, and worked a project that did what my old chatbot used to do. That said, I also wanted it to try to pull live data, and not just prescripted responses. 

2016/2017 hits, and at work, Im asked to present for MMAC Be The Spark tour, where I took Sarra, tied her with Alice (and updated some of the scripts) as well as Microsoft cognitive servics and presented a vocal chat bot that could detect and translate on the fly. The next year, I improved the UI where you could run it on a webpage and it would automaticly translate the text for you. The prior year, it would auto detect, and output both english and spanish. The new version could detect, call, and translate from your native language to english and back.

Having this unused code base, and while off work for a bit, I wanted to take it and release it to the world. So, I converted my AIML over to Riverscript, and am using the [RiverScript](https://www.rivescript.com/) project in Javascript to do all the work. I will be implementing translation in the next release.
