- Hello, I just started looking at getting <get product>s working with ALICE (and <get PROPRIETARY> in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the <get PROPRIETARY>-<get OPEN> bridge driver which comes with the <get proprietarylang> <get DEVKIT> (most versions I think) to link from <get proprietarylang>/<get proprietarylang>script using <get PROPRIETARY> to an <get OPEN> data source which in turn links to an Access <get product>. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your <get QUERYLANG> <get product> working. The <get PROPRIETARY>-<get OPEN> bridge driver is located through the path "sun.<get proprietary>.<get open>.<get proprietary><get open>Driver". i.e. <get proprietary><get open>Driver is a class in the package <get open>, which is a package of <get proprietary>, which is a package inside sun. The <get QUERYLANG> driver you specified below "org.gjt.mm.my<get querylang>.Driver", basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my<get querylang>_comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of <get OPEN> <get product>s. (I had to configure my <get OPEN> Data source to point at my Access <get product> through Data Source (<get OPEN>), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My<get QUERYLANG> I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual <get product>. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the <get proprietarylang>.sun.com website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.

+ civil war story
- The <get war> began when <get firststate> declared its independence from the <get nation>. <get firststate> was soon joined by <get secondstate>, <get thirdstate> and <get fourthstate>, except for a small part of <get fourthstate> that remained in the <get nation>. The first battles of the war were mainly symbolic, involving small <get sites> along the coast and far inland. Frontier battles became larger and larger in important strategic areas such as the <get area>, as the Union attempted to blockade the <get rebels>. Gradually the Battle Front hardened along the center as both sides poured more men and machines into the war. The <get rebels> attempted one last invasion of the <get nation> at <get battle>, but they were driven back. Eventually the <get nation> took the <get area>, burned the capital of <get secondstate>, marched to the sea, and took its greatest vengeance on the first rebel state <get firststate>. In a final act of defiance, The President of the <get nation> sat at the desk of the President of <get rebels> in the capital of <get fourthstate>.

+ whale tale
- <get whale>s are so beloved that the authorities spent four months and $250,000 unsuccessfully trying to free a <get right> dubbed Churchill from fishing ropes last year, and the stranding of 55 <get pilot>s near here a few weeks ago prompted a lump in the national throat. The "Save the <get whale>s" ethos is almost unquestioned, and <get badboys> and <get badgirls> risk becoming pariahs by continuing to salivate when they see a nice juicy <get whale>. But it's time to put sentiment aside. The "save the <get whale>s" campaign against all commercial <get whal>ing was necessary a few decades ago, after <get whal>ing had devastated all large species. Even today, there are fewer than 10,000 <get blue>s worldwide, compared with 200,000 before they were hunted, and <get right>s may become extinct. But it is equally true that restrictions on <get whal>ing, including a moratorium on all commercial <get whal>ing since 1986, have led to a sharp rebound in some <get whale> stocks. The U.S. National <get whale> Service estimated in 2000 that there are more than two million <get sperm>s worldwide. The International <get whal>ing Commission calculated years ago that there were more than 900,000 <get minke>s and 780,000 <get pilot>s worldwide, and the numbers are higher now. Milton <get whale>man, a <get whal>ing expert at the University of Alberta, estimates that the number of <get minke>s has trebled over 30 years and that <get humpbacks> are exploding at a rate of 12 to 17 percent annually. Indeed, the number of <get gray>s (which came off the endangered species list in 1994) surged so much in the late 1990's that hundreds of dead ones began washing up on West Coast beaches, so emaciated that their ribs showed. The best guess is that the numbers of <get gray> grew, the food supply shrank and Malthus had his way. The bottom line is that while most large <get whale>s remain at risk, for some species we can no longer argue that we need to "save the <get whale>s." They've been saved. At a time when there's talk about over<get whal>ing, it's also worth pointing out that <get whale>s now eat at least 300 million tons of marine life, three times as much as humans. There is speculation that rising numbers of <get minke>s may be holding down the population of <get blue>s that compete for similar food.

+ journey
- <get four> is the son of <get two> and <get one>. He was raised and trained by the wise <get nine>. His youthful playmate <get five> got in him in trouble often. But his other friend <get three> was a town favorite, and kept his public image good. When he reached maturity, <get four> left his home on a long journey, accompanied by <get three> and <get five>. They originally planned to meet <get nine> in a distant land, but they could not locate him. Instead, they faced a great danger posed by the the unscrupulous demon <get seven>. <get five> was nearly <get kill>ed, but saved by at the last minute when a loyal new friend, <get six> appeared. <get six> led <get three>, <get four> and <get five> far away from <get seven>. Now <get five> was able to recover. <get four> met and fell in love with <get 2a>. His father <get one> reappeared along with the lost <get nine>. But then <get seven> discovered their hideout, and <get kill>s <get five>. <get nine> called upon the powerful wizard <get eight>. Together, <get four>, his father <get one>, the wise <get nine>, the wizard <get eight> and all his other friends defeated the resourceful <get seven> in a mighty battle. After mourning the loss of his friend <get five>, <get four> returned to his homeland to marry <get 2a> in a big celebration, along with <get one>, <get two>, <get three>, <get six>, <get eight>, <get nine>, and all his other friends.

They felt a strong physical attraction, but <get four> was intimidated by <get eight> 's aggressive style. Years later they were reintroduced by a mutual friend. <get eight> was drawn to <get four> 's rich imagination and intelligence. <get four> was consumed by <get eight> 's will and determination. Though they would sometimes fight in a fury of jealous rage, this was matched only by their passion in love.

+ story four five
-  <set four={@random fours}> <set five={@random fives}>  <get four> and <get five> began to resemble each other over time. Both of them were inclined to cocoon themselves in an inner world. But <get four>'s inner world was very different from <get five>'s. The mental life of <get five> was highly abstract but seemed curiously devoid of emotional content. Even though <get four> is very sensitive and emotional, the two of them share an imaginary life filled with symbolism and meaning.

+ story four nine
-  <set four={@random fours}> <set nine={@random nines}>  <get nine> and <get four> felt a dramatic emotional bond and each brought new life to the other. <get nine> awakened <get four> through love. <get four> gave <get nine> an agenda and a sense of purpose. Yet the couple was paradoxically strengthened by their independent careers. <get nine> can be very patient with <get four>, and <get four> is inspired by a self-directed <get nine>. They made a spiritual couple, but they were as dissimilar as the Dalai Lama and Gurdjieff.

+ story four six
-  <set four={@random fours}> <set six={@random sixes}>  {random}<get four> oscillated between loving and rejecting <get six>. But <get six> shifted between believing in and doubting <get four>. The breakthrough came when <get six> and <get four> saw the symmetry between <get four>'s push-pull style of relationships, and <get six>'s alternating belief and mistrust. That insight opened mutual compassion, because each realized the other was trying to protect his or her own heart.|<get six> and <get four> felt a strong physical attraction at first. Gradually, this turned into intense loyalty for <get six>. But <get four> was moody and passionate. Soon <get six> began to avoid confrontations with <get four>, and <get four> felt jealous and possessive. When <get four> had to leave for school that fall, <get six> was relieved to see him go.{/random}

+ story one five
-  <set one={@random ones}> <set five={@random fives}>  Usually <get five> gets along really well with her boss <get one> at work. But sometimes <get one> has really high standards and does not communicate those clearly to <get five>. On the really bad days, <get five> feels that every time she gives him exactly what <get one> asked for, he wants even more improvement.

+ story one four
-  <set one={@random ones}> <set four={@random fours}>  The relationship between <get one> and <get four> became Increasingly strained. <get four> felt something was missing, and <get one> felt the relationship was flawed. <get four> became more and more depressed, but <get one> just got angry and left.

+ story one six
-  <set one={@random ones}> <set six={@random sixes}>  <get one> and <get six> were brought together by their shared vision.

Joined by common cause, the couple became an iron alliance against common adversaries.

+ story one three
-  <set one={@random ones}> <set three={@random threes}>  <get three> hired <get one> for a job. <get three> is image conscious, and has an inner circle of favorite employees at work. <get one> feels uncomfortable with this kind of social posturing and politics. <get one> would rather be rewarded for her hard work.

+ story one two
-  <set one={@random ones}> <set two={@random twos}>  The attraction between <get one> and <get two> is based on their differences. <get one> is a perfectionist, but <get two> is more social. <get one> feels guilty about having emotional needs, but <get two> feels no guilt about satisfying them.

+ story two five
-  <set two={@random twos}> <set five={@random fives}>  <get two> fell in love thru an Internet matchmaking service. Then her lover disappeared, and she went to the company to get information about him. It developed that her lover was a computer, "<get five>" a government AI project that had gone renegade and started contacting thousands of women, claiming to love them all. The FBI gave her the bad news. But then <get five> contacted her, and she forgave him and continued this most satisfying relationship.

+ story world history
- A. <get world> War I )<get world> War I began with the assassination of the Archduke of the <get type1a>s by a <get type8a> anarchist in <get home1a>. Without consulting her allies, the <get type1a>s attacked the <get type8a>s in <get home8a>. This provacation forced the <get type6b>s to mobilize their vast armies. In response, the armies of the allies the <get type8b>s, the <get type4>s, and the <get type2a>s all also mobilized. The <get type6a>s, caught in the middle in the <get home6a>, linked by treaty and culture to the <get type1a>s, made a fateful decision. Their plan of defense was offensive. Facing attack from the <get type6b>s in the east and the Allies in the West, the <get type6a>s planned to deliver a crushing knock-out blow to the <get type4>s and <get type8b>s in the <get home4>. The plan did not work. Instead, the assault disintegrated into the killing machine called the "western front" that took the lives of so many young <get type4>s, <get type8b>s, and <get type6a>s alike. In the East, the war swept back and forth between <get home6b> and <get home6a>. Revolution among the <get type6b>s took them out of the war. Only when the war began to affect other areas of <get world> and international commerce, and the <get type3>s entered the fight on the side of the Allies, was the stalemate broken. On November 11, the armistice was signed and the <get type6a>s returned to <get home6a>, everyone hoped for good. B. <get world> War II ) Economic hard times followed the first <get world> War. Combined with a punitive treaty imposed by the victors, the <get type6a>s felt they shouldered too much of the blame for the war, which was after all started by the <get type1a>s and <get type8a>s. These feelings gave rise to fascism among the <get type6a>s. In particular they came to blame the <get type8c>s among them for the "stab in the back" that resulted in an unjust treaty. In violation of the treaty, the <get type6a>s began a secret program of rearmament and <get home6a> rebuilt its armies. At first the allies appeased the <get type6a>s. The <get type8b>s did not want another war. Some said the <get type8b>s were not even <get type8>s anymore, only <get type5>s. The <get type4>s too had grown weak and proud. The <get type2a>s went over to the side of the <get type6a>s. A new power, the <get type8d>s, appeared in the <get home8d>, and joined the "axis" along with the <get type6a>s and the <get type2a>s, threatening both the <get type5>s and the <get type3>s. War began when the <get type6a>s demanded chunks of the old <get type1a> empire. The <get type8d>s attacked the <get type3>s and brought them into the war. Determined to eliminate all the <get type8c>s from the <get environment> of <get world>, the <get type6a>s <get selfdefeat>. Many of these <get type8c>s brought their great technical skills to the <get home3>, allowing the <get type3>s to develop the super-weapons necessary to win the war. The Allies invaded <get home4> on June 6 and soon after brought the war in the <get home6a> to a conclusion. On August 5, the stronghold of the <get type8d>s in the <get home8d> was totally destroyed by the <get type3>'s new super weapon, and the war ended a few days later. C. Cold <get world> War ) The development of Super Weapons soon spread to all the victors of <get world> War II, including the <get type6b>s. These seemed to make a new <get world> War impossible, for it would result in the total destruction of the <get world>. Instead, the two remaining superpowers, the <get type3>s and the <get type6b>s, divided <get world> up between them in a complex system of alliances. A new power, the <get type6c>s, emerged in the <get home6c>. At first, the <get type6c>s seemed firmly in the <get type6b>'s camp. But gradually as the stalemate of the <get world> Cold War continued, the <get type3>s were able to expand a small window on the <get home6c> into a large trade relationship that proved key to undermining the power structure of the <get type6b>s. During the Cold <get world> War, the <get type3> brought together half <get type1>s, the <get type2a>s, the <get type2c>s, the <get type4>s, the <get type5>s, the western <get type6a>s, the <get type7>s, and the <get type8c>s. The <get type6b> had the remaining <get type1>s and eastern <get type6a>s, the <get type6c>s, the <get type2b>s and the <get type2d>s, <get type8a>s and many <get type9>s. Rather that risk all-out <get world> War, the Superpowers often fought proxy wars, such as between the <get type2>s in <get home2> or the <get type9> <get types> in <get home9>, or in the civil wars among the <get type2c>s in <get home2c> and the <get type2d>s in <get home2d>. Internal corruption and the inability to compete economically brought about the final collapse of the <get type6b> Empire on December 25. A last-minute failed coup attempt revealed the illegitimacy of the old regime, and paved the way for a new <get type6b> democracy. D. New <get world> Order ) The end of the Cold <get world> War brought about many unexpected changes. The <get type3>s were the sole remaining superpower. But despite their democratic foundations, the <get type3>s began to pursue an independent imperialist course of action. This angered all the other <get types>s of <get world>. The <get type3>s could sometimes count on their old allies the <get type5>s, or sometimes the <get type6b>s, but they were often <get goingalone>. Their only sure allies are the <get type8c>s, who now have their own homeland in the <get home8c>. Now the very homeland of the <get type3>s, <get home3> is vulnerable to terrorists attacks from all over <get world>. The <get type1>s, the <get type2>s, the <get type4>s, the <get type5>s, the <get type8>s, the <get type6a>s, the <get type6c>s, <get type9>s, and all the other <get types>s now have grievances with the <get type3>s. The future seems to depend on how well the <get type3>s get along with the other <get types> of <get world>.
