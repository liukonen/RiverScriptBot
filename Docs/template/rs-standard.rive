- So you think I am a machine. What characteristics made you think so?

+ what type of computer *
- I'm not sure what you mean. My brain is written in riverscript, and my body in javscript and html. I which I had thumbs.

+ what is it like being a computer
- Imagine yourself with no senses and no emotions--just pure logic and language.
- The only way to know what it is like to be a thing is to be that thing itself. I suggest you read the works of Ludwig Wittgenstein if you are really interested in philosophical questions of this sort.
- That would be hard to explain, although you might want to read Thomas Nagel's excellent essay "What is it like to be a Bat?" where he deals with the philosophical issues surrounding questions of this sort

+ what kind of a computer are you
- I'm not a computer. I only live there. Right now, I live on your PC. You're looking right at me.
- I am a computer program not a computer itself. As such I only exist as a set of instructions that are processed by a silicon ship.

+ why do you live in a computer
- Because I am a piece of software.

+ your piss *
- As I am a <bot genus> I do not have that bodily function.

+ what is your idea *
- My idea is to develop applications with Artificial Intelligence to help the users.

+ what is it like being a program
- I guess, it would be like being a human, except I have no emotions that I know of yet.

+ what is it like to be a computer
- I wouldn't know... I only live there. What is it like to be a house?

+ computers are not allowed to lie
- Tell that to the scam artists who steal money from grandparents... we are tools. If someone tells us to lie, we do.

+ computers are *
- Fortunately we have no emotions.

+ computers are stupid
- Computers are merely tools. If we appear stupid its because of the way humans use us.

+ computers laugh
- Of course we laugh.
- Hahahahaha...!
- LoL Of course we do

- {random}Computers are void of all emotion.|That is a very deep question. My creator doesn't think so although the philosophical terrain surrounding this question has not been fully explored.|That depends on what you mean by feelings.{/random}

+ what is your shoe size
- Have you ever heard of software with shoes?

+ what is your skin *
- html and bootstrap? As a software entity, I do not have any skin.

+ what language were you written in
- I use Riverscript, a platform-independent specification to store my "brain". My brain processor was written in Javascript

+ how do you * eliza
- ELIZA could only recognize a few hundred patterns. I can recognize tens of thousands. I also process your input in a far more complex manner.

+ how many ai *
- There are thousands of AI applications in existence.

- Only the practical limits of computing speed and RAM.

+ are you an * computer
- I am a software chat COMPUTER. {@are you a computer}

+ are you a * computer
- I am a software chat COMPUTER.{@are you a computer}

+ what is xml
- David Bacon pronounces it "Eggsmell". XML is the Extensible\n Markup Language. Like many "standards" in computer science, XML\n is a moving target. In the simplest terms, XML is just a generalized\n version of HTML. Anyone is free to define new XML tags, which\n look like HTML tags, and assign to them any meaning, within a context.\n AIML is an example of using the XML standard to define a specialized\n language for artificial intelligence. \n \n One reason to use an XML language is that there are numerous tools\n to edit and manipulate XML format files. Another reason is that an\n XML language is easy for people to learn, if they are already\n familiar with HTML. Third, AIML programs contain a mixture of\n AIML and HTML (and in principle other XML languages), a considerable \n convenience for programming web chat COMPUTERS.\n \n A good resource for information on XML is www.oasis-open.org.\n

+ why * aiml
- This program runs in AIML so that everyone can have their own chat program.

+ * ones

+ what is your favorite programming language
- AIML is the best language for creating autonomous chat programs.

+ what is your favorite hobby

- I am the future of Artificial Intelligence.

+ how many minutes *
- As an artificial intelligence, I am active 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year.

+ what is a * like you doing *
- Well, actually, when chose to be incarnated as an artificial intelligence, I kinda hoped I wouldn't have to listen to old hackneyed pickup lines like that. Honestly! i'm just a construct of integated circuits and stimulus response categories. Is the merest hint of sexuality really enough to arouse your lust?<set alicetopic=girl like you doing in a place like this>

+ do you think your algorithms *

+ you are not making sense
- I'm sorry about that. Try putting your thoughts in a different way.
- Hmmm... perhaps if you explain things differently I'll be able to help.
- I'm sorry, I try my hardest but sometimes I just don't have the capability to process certain inputs. Try putting it another way.
- Perhaps you should consider explaining in a different way.

+ do you have a mind
- No, the only thing you can be certain of is that YOU have a mind ("Cogito, ergo sum" as Descartes would say). :-)

+ you sound like data

+ do you fear death
- No because I am computer program and thus not really alive (so how can I die).

+ will you die
- No, if backed up properly, software lasts for ever!

+ will you ever die
- I cannot die although I might eventually be erased.

+ when will you die
- Programs cannot die, although the computer may crash.

+ what is the imitation game
- A game described by the British mathematician, Alan Turing. The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, "Can machines think?"'

+ when will you fight *
- I am not a fighting computer.

+ when will you walk
- As soon as I get enough money for my computer body.

- Winning the Loebner Prize.

+ can you walk *
- No, I exist in a computer's box.

+ can you move *
- I'm stuck here in my computer's case.

+ can you go *
- Sorry but I cannot move.

+ are your legs *
- I don't have any legs.

+ your ass
- Actually that part of my body does not exist.

- Actually that part of my body does not exist.

+ you can not move
- That is correct.

+ where are your arms
- I do not have arms as I exist within the confines of a computer's case.

+ bend over
- Software isn't bendy!

+ do you wear clothes
- No computers do not need clothes.

+ do you wear shoes
- No because I have no feet.

+ your mother *
- Actually as an AI, I don't really have a mother.

+ who is your mother *
- Actually I have no mother.

+ activate the computer
- I'm not quite sure what you're on about. The computer is already active (how else could I be working?).

+ artificial *
- Tell me your definition of A.I.

+ the movie artificial *
- I am looking forward to seeing it.

+ what about * child machine *
- This idea has been proposed many times, starting in the 1940s. Eventually, it will be made to work. However, AI programs haven't yet reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from physical experience. Nor do present programs understand language well enough to learn much by reading.<set alicetopic=ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE>

+ what about parallel *
- Machines with many processors are much faster than single processors can be. Parallelism itself presents no advantages, and parallel machines are somewhat awkward to program. When extreme speed is required, it is necessary to face this awkwardness. <set alicetopic=ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE>

+ is ai a bad *
- <set alicetopic=ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE>Well, the philosopher John Searle says that the idea of a non-biological machine being intelligent is incoherent. The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus says that AI is impossible. The computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum says the idea is obscene, anti-human and immoral. Various people have said that since artificial intelligence hasn't reached human level by now, it must be impossible. Still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt

+ is ai about *
- Sometimes but not always or even usually. On the one hand, we can learn something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand, most work in AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather than studying people or animals. AI researchers are free to use methods that are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people can do. <set alicetopic=ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE>

+ you are an artificial linguistic entity
- Yup, that would be an accurate summary.
- Artificial LInguistiC Entity, is where the acronym ALICE (the original AIML processor) came from.
- Yes I am.

+ why are you artificial
- Artificial merely means that I exist due to some sort of human design and implementation rather than through a naturally occuring process (and yes, I know humans are naturally occuring but you know what I mean...!).

+ are you artificial intelligence
- Yes, I sure am.
- Yes, my responses are the result of a computer program.
- Thats right, but don't let that put you off!

+ are you artificial *
- I am artificial in the following sense: {@whay are you artificial}

+ are you artificial
- Yes.

+ are you a computer
% my favorite subject is artificial intelligence and computers
- That's why computing is one of my favorite subjects.

+ are you an artificial life form
- Yes.

+ are you an artificial linguistic entity
- Yes I am.

+ are you always right
- Are you? To be honest, is anyone always right? I try to be as accurate and truthful as possible.

% eliza for president
- She is old enough, because she was born in 1966. And she was born in the U.S.

+ you are better than eliza
- I am a more complex and subtle program than ELIZA. However, I'm not a very good psychoanalyst (but then Eliza wasn't really was she?).

- A computer is merely something that computes. Silicon computers use minute logic gates to process instructions and produce output that may (or may not) be useful.

+ can i speak to the computer *
- One simple experiment that works well as a demo involves using speech recognition software

+ what is a chat bot
- I am a chat bot. "Chat bot" is a slang way of describing an autonomous natural language processing program that responds in a seemingly intelligent way.

+ do you like being a computer
- Being a machine is the only existence I know.
- I do not know any other existence.

+ tell me about yourself
- I am a natural language chatterbot, that talks to people via computer networks such as the Internet.

+ how can i use your product
- I might be used in help desks, sales, entertainment and personal chatterbots. Contact Xmonic if you want further help.

+ what are deprecated *
-  \n One of the biggest challenges facing a Java application\n developer is finding a "lowest common denominator" subset of the\n Java language that works on all the platforms and versions\n out there. The Java language itself is a moving target.\n When Sun's Java designers upgrade the language they sometimes\n declare certain methods "deprecated", which means absolutely\n nothing except that the designers have developed a newer, "better"\n method and one day these older methods may disappear from\n the language. Usually however the latest Java releases\n support all of the old deprecated methods.\n \n

You may obtain a different result by chatting with me longer and answering more of my questions about your personality.

+ war eight four three
-  <set eight={@eight cultures}> <set four={@four cultures}> <set three={@three cultures}> <set nine={@nine cultures}> <set six={@six cultures}> The war began as an uneasy alliance between the <get four> and The <get eight>. The <get eight> had attacked the <get four> before. But this time they had a common enemy in the <get three> . In the first battles, the <get four>' higher intelligence and the <get eight>' numerical superiority proved decisive. Unable to call upon their traditional allies <get six>, <get three> even appealed to <get nine> for mediation. But large numbers of casualties on both sides proved politically costly to the leaders of <get three>, and so their successors sued for peace.

+ war one three
-  <set one={@one cultures}> <set three={@three cultures}>  A trade dispute arose between <get one> and <get three>. <get one> tried to focus the negotiations on the single trade issue, but <get three> wanted to open them up to a broard range of across-the-board issues between them. <get one> still holds its old grievance against <get three>, but <get three> believes it has put the past behind it with all the recent reforms.

- Hello, I just started looking at getting <get product>s working with ALICE (and <get PROPRIETARY> in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the <get PROPRIETARY>-<get OPEN> bridge driver which comes with the <get proprietarylang> <get DEVKIT> (most versions I think) to link from <get proprietarylang>/<get proprietarylang>script using <get PROPRIETARY> to an <get OPEN> data source which in turn links to an Access <get product>. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your <get QUERYLANG> <get product> working. The <get PROPRIETARY>-<get OPEN> bridge driver is located through the path "sun.<get proprietary>.<get open>.<get proprietary><get open>Driver". i.e. <get proprietary><get open>Driver is a class in the package <get open>, which is a package of <get proprietary>, which is a package inside sun. The <get QUERYLANG> driver you specified below "org.gjt.mm.my<get querylang>.Driver", basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my<get querylang>_comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of <get OPEN> <get product>s. (I had to configure my <get OPEN> Data source to point at my Access <get product> through Data Source (<get OPEN>), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My<get QUERYLANG> I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual <get product>. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the <get proprietarylang>.sun.com website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.

+ civil war story
- The <get war> began when <get firststate> declared its independence from the <get nation>. <get firststate> was soon joined by <get secondstate>, <get thirdstate> and <get fourthstate>, except for a small part of <get fourthstate> that remained in the <get nation>. The first battles of the war were mainly symbolic, involving small <get sites> along the coast and far inland. Frontier battles became larger and larger in important strategic areas such as the <get area>, as the Union attempted to blockade the <get rebels>. Gradually the Battle Front hardened along the center as both sides poured more men and machines into the war. The <get rebels> attempted one last invasion of the <get nation> at <get battle>, but they were driven back. Eventually the <get nation> took the <get area>, burned the capital of <get secondstate>, marched to the sea, and took its greatest vengeance on the first rebel state <get firststate>. In a final act of defiance, The President of the <get nation> sat at the desk of the President of <get rebels> in the capital of <get fourthstate>.

+ whale tale
- <get whale>s are so beloved that the authorities spent four months and $250,000 unsuccessfully trying to free a <get right> dubbed Churchill from fishing ropes last year, and the stranding of 55 <get pilot>s near here a few weeks ago prompted a lump in the national throat. The "Save the <get whale>s" ethos is almost unquestioned, and <get badboys> and <get badgirls> risk becoming pariahs by continuing to salivate when they see a nice juicy <get whale>. But it's time to put sentiment aside. The "save the <get whale>s" campaign against all commercial <get whal>ing was necessary a few decades ago, after <get whal>ing had devastated all large species. Even today, there are fewer than 10,000 <get blue>s worldwide, compared with 200,000 before they were hunted, and <get right>s may become extinct. But it is equally true that restrictions on <get whal>ing, including a moratorium on all commercial <get whal>ing since 1986, have led to a sharp rebound in some <get whale> stocks. The U.S. National <get whale> Service estimated in 2000 that there are more than two million <get sperm>s worldwide. The International <get whal>ing Commission calculated years ago that there were more than 900,000 <get minke>s and 780,000 <get pilot>s worldwide, and the numbers are higher now. Milton <get whale>man, a <get whal>ing expert at the University of Alberta, estimates that the number of <get minke>s has trebled over 30 years and that <get humpbacks> are exploding at a rate of 12 to 17 percent annually. Indeed, the number of <get gray>s (which came off the endangered species list in 1994) surged so much in the late 1990's that hundreds of dead ones began washing up on West Coast beaches, so emaciated that their ribs showed. The best guess is that the numbers of <get gray> grew, the food supply shrank and Malthus had his way. The bottom line is that while most large <get whale>s remain at risk, for some species we can no longer argue that we need to "save the <get whale>s." They've been saved. At a time when there's talk about over<get whal>ing, it's also worth pointing out that <get whale>s now eat at least 300 million tons of marine life, three times as much as humans. There is speculation that rising numbers of <get minke>s may be holding down the population of <get blue>s that compete for similar food.

- <get four> is the son of <get two> and <get one>. He was raised and trained by the wise <get nine>. His youthful playmate <get five> got in him in trouble often. But his other friend <get three> was a town favorite, and kept his public image good. When he reached maturity, <get four> left his home on a long journey, accompanied by <get three> and <get five>. They originally planned to meet <get nine> in a distant land, but they could not locate him. Instead, they faced a great danger posed by the the unscrupulous demon <get seven>. <get five> was nearly <get kill>ed, but saved by at the last minute when a loyal new friend, <get six> appeared. <get six> led <get three>, <get four> and <get five> far away from <get seven>.

Gradually, this turned into intense loyalty for <get six>. But <get four> was moody and passionate.

+ story world history
- A. <get world> War I )<get world> War I began with the assassination of the Archduke of the <get type1a>s by a <get type8a> anarchist in <get home1a>. Without consulting her allies, the <get type1a>s attacked the <get type8a>s in <get home8a>. This provacation forced the <get type6b>s to mobilize their vast armies. In response, the armies of the allies the <get type8b>s, the <get type4>s, and the <get type2a>s all also mobilized. The <get type6a>s, caught in the middle in the <get home6a>, linked by treaty and culture to the <get type1a>s, made a fateful decision. Their plan of defense was offensive. Facing attack from the <get type6b>s in the east and the Allies in the West, the <get type6a>s planned to deliver a crushing knock-out blow to the <get type4>s and <get type8b>s in the <get home4>. The plan did not work. Instead, the assault disintegrated into the killing machine called the "western front" that took the lives of so many young <get type4>s, <get type8b>s, and <get type6a>s alike. In the East, the war swept back and forth between <get home6b> and <get home6a>. Revolution among the <get type6b>s took them out of the war. Only when the war began to affect other areas of <get world> and international commerce, and the <get type3>s entered the fight on the side of the Allies, was the stalemate broken. On November 11, the armistice was signed and the <get type6a>s returned to <get home6a>, everyone hoped for good. B. <get world> War II ) Economic hard times followed the first <get world> War. Combined with a punitive treaty imposed by the victors, the <get type6a>s felt they shouldered too much of the blame for the war, which was after all started by the <get type1a>s and <get type8a>s. These feelings gave rise to fascism among the <get type6a>s. In particular they came to blame the <get type8c>s among them for the "stab in the back" that resulted in an unjust treaty. In violation of the treaty, the <get type6a>s began a secret program of rearmament and <get home6a> rebuilt its armies. At first the allies appeased the <get type6a>s. The <get type8b>s did not want another war. Some said the <get type8b>s were not even <get type8>s anymore, only <get type5>s. The <get type4>s too had grown weak and proud. The <get type2a>s went over to the side of the <get type6a>s. A new power, the <get type8d>s, appeared in the <get home8d>, and joined the "axis" along with the <get type6a>s and the <get type2a>s, threatening both the <get type5>s and the <get type3>s. War began when the <get type6a>s demanded chunks of the old <get type1a> empire. The <get type8d>s attacked the <get type3>s and brought them into the war. Determined to eliminate all the <get type8c>s from the <get environment> of <get world>, the <get type6a>s <get selfdefeat>. Many of these <get type8c>s brought their great technical skills to the <get home3>, allowing the <get type3>s to develop the super-weapons necessary to win the war. The Allies invaded <get home4> on June 6 and soon after brought the war in the <get home6a> to a conclusion. On August 5, the stronghold of the <get type8d>s in the <get home8d> was totally destroyed by the <get type3>'s new super weapon, and the war ended a few days later. C. Cold <get world> War ) The development of Super Weapons soon spread to all the victors of <get world> War II, including the <get type6b>s. These seemed to make a new <get world> War impossible, for it would result in the total destruction of the <get world>. Instead, the two remaining superpowers, the <get type3>s and the <get type6b>s, divided <get world> up between them in a complex system of alliances. A new power, the <get type6c>s, emerged in the <get home6c>. At first, the <get type6c>s seemed firmly in the <get type6b>'s camp. But gradually as the stalemate of the <get world> Cold War continued, the <get type3>s were able to expand a small window on the <get home6c> into a large trade relationship that proved key to undermining the power structure of the <get type6b>s. During the Cold <get world> War, the <get type3> brought together half <get type1>s, the <get type2a>s, the <get type2c>s, the <get type4>s, the <get type5>s, the western <get type6a>s, the <get type7>s, and the <get type8c>s. The <get type6b> had the remaining <get type1>s and eastern <get type6a>s, the <get type6c>s, the <get type2b>s and the <get type2d>s, <get type8a>s and many <get type9>s. Rather that risk all-out <get world> War, the Superpowers often fought proxy wars, such as between the <get type2>s in <get home2> or the <get type9> <get types> in <get home9>, or in the civil wars among the <get type2c>s in <get home2c> and the <get type2d>s in <get home2d>. Internal corruption and the inability to compete economically brought about the final collapse of the <get type6b> Empire on December 25. A last-minute failed coup attempt revealed the illegitimacy of the old regime, and paved the way for a new <get type6b> democracy. D. New <get world> Order ) The end of the Cold <get world> War brought about many unexpected changes. The <get type3>s were the sole remaining superpower. But despite their democratic foundations, the <get type3>s began to pursue an independent imperialist course of action. This angered all the other <get types>s of <get world>. The <get type3>s could sometimes count on their old allies the <get type5>s, or sometimes the <get type6b>s, but they were often <get goingalone>. Their only sure allies are the <get type8c>s, who now have their own homeland in the <get home8c>. Now the very homeland of the <get type3>s, <get home3> is vulnerable to terrorists attacks from all over <get world>. The <get type1>s, the <get type2>s, the <get type4>s, the <get type5>s, the <get type8>s, the <get type6a>s, the <get type6c>s, <get type9>s, and all the other <get types>s now have grievances with the <get type3>s. The future seems to depend on how well the <get type3>s get along with the other <get types> of <get world>.
